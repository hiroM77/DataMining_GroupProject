# DataMining_GroupProject

## Description

This is our Group Project in Data Mining class. This project analyzes data from the U.S. Department of Labor's PERM (Program Electronic Review Management) system, which tracks employment-based immigration petitions for foreign workers seeking U.S. permanent residency. By examining key factors such as job occupations, industries, geographical locations, salaries, and educational qualifications, we aim to uncover trends in the U.S. labor market and the demand for foreign workers. Our analysis explores how these trends are influenced by technological advancements, economic shifts, and immigration policies, with the goal of informing policy decisions and providing insights into workforce development and industry needs.

Key areas the we are going to focus are geographical distribution of foreign workers, industry-specific demand for immigrant labor, salary trends and wage implications across sectors, and impact of education and work experience on immigration outcomes.

This research is designed to support data-driven decision-making for policymakers, businesses, and foreign workers, contributing to the development of balanced, effective immigration policies and workforce strategies.
